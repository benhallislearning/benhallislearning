Hello!

I'm Ben and have been learning about computing in earnest after I overheard someone say "Python is written in Python!". At the suggestion of a couple of friends I'd tried to learn a little Python before, but it didn't really gel at the time because I was dumb back then. 

That remark changed everything and it was a lightbulb moment for me. I realised I'd never really thought about computing before - at least not deeply, and I suddenly realised that Python must've been (initially at least) written in an older language, and that proccess must've been recursive. But what was that language and how did it get written in the first place? And does this mean all the languages do all the things? My head was spinning a little. Why had I not thought about any of this the first time around?

I went home that day and read about machine code, assembly language and c. I learnt how simple switches in series and in parallel can calculate things and simulate universes. It was and still is quite a shock, but I knew then and there I wanted to learn more. I learnt the basics of c, about Turing Completeness, about stacks, scopes, heaps and pointers. Then, with some basic foundations to build upon, I moved back to Python. From there I moved on to data structures and finally some small projects.

Anyway, I'm now hoping to get a junior coding position in a company and thought I'd finally start posting some code on Github. I'll start doing some basic data structures and then move on to more personal projects. I feel massively underqualified in this area (because I am) and a total imposter even trying to switch carrers like this, but losing my job during the pandemic gave me a chance to learn something new that I genuinely enjoy.
